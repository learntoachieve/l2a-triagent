# Triagent

Triagent is a ticket-triage trainer built on top of live GitHub issues. It pulls real, open
issues from public repositories, scores them for solvability and difficulty, and presents them as a
workable ticket queue so you can practice triaging and solving real-world work instead of toy
problems. This repository currently contains the project skeleton; ingestion, scoring, and the
agent are built in later phases.

## Quickstart

```powershell
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the package with dev tooling
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the three quality gates
ruff check .
mypy .
pytest -q
```

## Project layout (target)

The structure below is the intended end state. Most directories do not exist yet — each is built in
its own phase. The phase tag (`[P#]`) marks when a part comes online.
