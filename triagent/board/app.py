"""Minimal Streamlit board: browse the scored issue queue.

    streamlit run triagent/board/app.py

Each issue is LEFT JOINed to its latest score, so the queue sorts "most
solvable first" instead of a flat dump. Unscored issues still appear (with
blank score cells). The DB read is factored into ``load_issues()`` so it can be
checked without launching the server.
